<h3>About</h3>
Front. Vet. Sci., 21 July 2021 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.674730<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.674730"></a>

<h3>Summary</h3>

Extra-label drug use in food animal medicine is authorized by the US Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA), and estimated withdrawal intervals are based on published scientific pharmacokinetic data. Occasionally there is a paucity of scientific data on which to base a withdrawal interval or a large number of animals being treated, driving the need to test for drug residues. Rapid assay commercial farm-side tests are essential for monitoring drug residues in animal products to protect human health. Active ingredients, sensitivity, matrices, and species that have been evaluated for commercial rapid assay tests are typically reported on manufacturers' websites or in PDF documents that are available to consumers but may require a special access request.
